This is a project for practice with python framework Flet.
Currently, I have problem with passing data from one view to another.

before start main.py is required to install flet "pip install flet"

after start main.py press button "go to page test". there are four generated buttons,
first three use one methodology to pass data and the last button use second methodology.

I added some prints and comments for check and show how values were assigned, but when
I try to pass that data into fields of new page, that fields are empty.
